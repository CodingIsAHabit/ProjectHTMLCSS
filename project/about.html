		<h2>We are a small company.</h2>
		
		<p>Don't let our size fool you, for our workers and employees are the best a company could wish for! 
		We offer a comfortable workspace, and equal payment for all. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. 
		We have contacts all around the world, and those people are who need ot be thanked for our weekly
		expeditions.</p>

		<h2>Our future, is you.</h2>
		
		<p>Those who do not want to build a better future for the next generation, have doomed this world. 
		We must take good care of Earth's lush beauties and scenery, but we won't be able to do that forever. 
		This is why we need you to take initiative as a photographer, to show those who cannot see for themselves, 
		how truly awe-inspiring this little blue marble is.</p>

		<h2>We work for a better future.</h2>
		
		<p>Part of our task, our pledge, is to document world heritage and other sites around the world. 
		Should any of them be destroyed, or rather withered away due to the passing of time, we will have 
		the proof to say "Hey, this used to be like on the pictures. We should make it like that again...".</p>
